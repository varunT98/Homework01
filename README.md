# Homework01
Implementing a c program that uses dynamic memory allocation, structures, and string functions provided by the C library.


#Description
The theme of this project is to write a C program with variable number of keywords as Command Line Arguments, it reads the text and searches in the input stream till the end, and when it reaches it prints how many number of keywords repeated in the input text.


#Getting Started
These steps will give you an idea of the project. Moreover, we do run our program in our local system for testing and developing.

#Prerequisites
Requirements for the software to run, execute, and develop are:
gcc - GNU Compiler Collection
Text-editor

#installing
Here we discuss how installation process work
* Open the text editor 
* create a c programing file
* save the file with .c extension

#Running the tests
In this program we consider taking command line arguments as well as general input stream as input. In Command Line Arguments it contains keywords, count and we use a loop to update the count. In this program we use several methods and functions to write our C program. For instance, getline, strok.

To understand the execution part in a better way how a program is executed. First, use 'gcc filename.c' to compile. Then, run using './a.out'.

To run the program, we should do these steps:
1.gcc example.c
2. ./a.out an the or
a an an the the or

output:
a : 0
an: 2
the:2
or:1
